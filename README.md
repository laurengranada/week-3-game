# Hangman Game : Drake Style

### Overview

Created a hangman-like game (without the hangman), driven by javascript logic. Stylized the site with a looping video, to simulate a gif, as the background. 
When the site loads, a Drake song is played in the background. The user must then guess the title of the song until they get it correct or...run out of chances.
